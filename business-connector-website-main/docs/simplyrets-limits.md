# SimplyRETS API Rate Limits & Property Restrictions

## Key Findings from Service Level Agreement

### API Rate Limitations

**Concurrent Requests:**
- Maximum: **5 concurrent API requests**
- Requests within the same 1-second interval count as concurrent

**Daily Requests:**
- Each account has a **daily maximum request limit**
- Limit depends on the **type of account**
- Accounts must not exceed the maximum limit per day
- Subject to rate limiting responses if exceeded

### Important: NO PROPERTY COUNT LIMIT

**Critical Discovery:**
- SimplyRETS does NOT limit the NUMBER of properties
- Limits are on API REQUESTS, not property count
- You can access ALL properties in your connected MLS feed
- The $49/month plan gives you access to the ENTIRE MLS

### What This Means for Your Business

**Property Access:**
- ✅ 8,000-12,000+ properties from Stellar MLS
- ✅ NO per-property charges
- ✅ NO property count restrictions
- ✅ Access to ALL active listings in your MLS

**API Request Strategy:**
- Daily sync job = 1-2 API requests per day
- Each property search = 1 API request
- Well within daily limits for normal usage
- Our automated sync runs once daily (minimal API usage)

### Pricing Tiers (Speculation based on research)

**$49/month (Basic):**
- Likely: 1,000-5,000 API requests per day
- More than enough for daily sync + user searches
- Access to entire MLS feed

**$99-199/month (Premium):**
- Likely: Higher daily API request limits
- For high-traffic websites
- Still access to same MLS data

## Conclusion

**You can display 8,000-12,000+ properties on the $49/month plan!**

The pricing is based on:
1. API request volume (not property count)
2. Number of MLS feeds connected
3. Support level

For your use case (daily sync + moderate user traffic), the $49/month plan is perfect.
